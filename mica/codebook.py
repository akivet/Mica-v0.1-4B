"""The fixed output codebook shared by training, evaluation and deployment.

Every judgment is read out of one forward pass as a distribution over label
tokens, so the labels must each be a single token in the deployed tokenizer and
must not move between training and serving. The first 52 entries are the
original A-Z/a-z labels, so an adapter trained before the codebook grew keeps
its exact output rows; the rest are the uppercase two-letter combinations that
this tokenizer encodes as one token, in alphabetical order, up to the 255
candidates a Choice may carry.

``No``/``Yes`` are the Noul readout and are kept separate from the Choice
labels: they are distinct single tokens, and a Noul never uses a letter label.
